Capstone 1 project Lariat Data Model and Dashboard

Lariat 2018 Data Model with Projections for Increasing Profit and Lowering Costs																				
	Business Objective: Increase profits and lower costs overall																			
																				
		Strategy 1: Simply remove negative profit vehicles from stock																		
		Strategy 2: Simply remove all low plus negative profits vehicles from stock																		
		Strategy 3: Increase marketing and promotions to draw more of the market share's business and grow 20%																		
		Strategy4: Increase branch numbers to increase profit																		
																				
																				
	*Notes about this Workbook*																			
																				
	There are 2 sheets here to review:																			
		Baseline Model: shows all of the baseline calculations that led me to these insights																		
		Dashboard: shows detail about the vehicles and each individual ID of a vehicle can be looked at in detail																		
																				
	Both sheets have interactive sections highlighted in light yellow. 																			
		*In the Baseline Model, you can add different amounts in the "Expected Growth" field to get a better idea of what more or less growth would mean.																		
		*Also, in the Baseline Model you can add different numbers in the "Add Branches" field to determine costs related to any number of branches you might want to evaluate. 																		
		*In the Dashboard, you can input or use the drop down for any ID number and see details regarding profit and information for any specific vehicle with a chart that changes next to it																		
																				
	As you see, in My baseline modelâ€¦ Strategy 2 did not work out positively, but I am leaving the numbers there as well to show what would happen if that was done.
